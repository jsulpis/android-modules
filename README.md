This project provides a set of modules that are meant to be copied / pasted into an application. The modules are implementations of common Android components that are used in many applications. Each module is independent so you can choose one that interests you and reuse it in your own application.

## Content

* **camera-photo**: takes a photo by an external app and saves it in the gallery.
* **nav-drawer**: a navigation drawer (side menu) with fragments associated with each menu item.
* **nav-swipe**: navigation between tabs by swiping on the screen. Comes with the tabs navigation menu.
* **opengles-basics**: basic usage of the OpenGL|ES library. Displays a triangle using the library components.
* **opengles-load-obj**: loads a 3D object from an obj file and displays it using OpenGL|ES.
* **sensors-overview**: shows basic usage of sensors on an Android application.
* **storage-files-io**: shows how to write and read files on internal and external storage.


## Usage

The most simple way of using these modules is to download this project and open it in Android Studio. Then browse the modules and launch them on the emulator or your physical device to see how they behave. If you want to reuse one module in your application, just copy / paste the code from the module into your application.
